# Using docker container

1. Using docker container to create the python environment for openfermion.

## 1. Install docker

1. Install the docker [guidance](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/) in English.
2. Install the docker [guidance](https://yeasy.gitbook.io/docker_practice/install/windows) in Chinese.
3. After install docker, you can check it in the console by running2

    ``` console
    docker --help
    ```

## 2. Install the image of openfermion

- Modification of the docker file download from the [URL](https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion/blob/master/docker/dockerfile)
  - I add the pip install of the pyscf from github
  - I add the pip install of the jupyter


1. You can use either of the following
   1. Installation [guidance](https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion/tree/master/docker)
   2. Build command [guidance](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/)
   3. Using vscode docker build.
2. Before build the image, you'd better to clear all the cache:

    ```console
    docker system prune --volumes
    ```

3. I will use the following command, get from the vscode build command.
   1. --pull Always attempt to pull a newer version of the image
   2. --rm Delete the intermediate container after setting the image successfully
   3. -f Name of the Dockerfile (Default is'PATH/Dockerfile')
   4. -t Name and optionally a tag in the 'name:tag' format, the name will be used as the name of the image.
   5. .  The current working directory

    ```console
    cd PATH/Environment_config
    docker build --pull --rm -f "openfermion_docker" -t openfermion:first .
    ```

4. After building, which may take 30 minutes in the first time,  you can use the image in the docker container app.
5. To check the image in the docker container, using the command:

    ``` console
    docker image ls
    ```

## Runing the openfermion image

1. running the image for jupyter notebook
2. Run the command in the console
   1. -i: -i, --interactive Keep STDIN open even if not attached
   2. -t: Allocate a pseudo-TTY, it will show the linux console
   3. -p: Publish a container's port(s) to the host
   4. -v: mount the local folder to the container's directory. For example, Here I mount the localpath/VQE to the container_root/VQE. Then using !ls in the jupyter notebook, we can see the VQE folder in the root path.
   5. name:tag indicator for the container

   ```console
    docker run -it --rm -v absolute_path/VQE:/VQE -p 8888:8888 openfermion:first
    ```

### Run the jupyter notebook in the container

1. If you see the command line like: "root@6af5ceab05c1:/# ", then you are succeed entering the container
2. Run the jupyter, the port used here should be the same as the port defined above

    ``` console
    jupyter-notebook --allow-root --no-browser --port 8888 --ip=0.0.0.0
    ```

3. Create a remote jupyter server in the vscode. And choose the server to run the local jupyter notebook.
